    "You should see a few `.sql` files. The file `create.sql` contains SQL statements to create the database schema. It is actually incomplete. Your first job is to edit this file to enforce a number of constraints below. You may modify the CREATE statements in the file as you see fit, but do not introduce new columns, tables, views, or triggers unless instructed otherwise. If there are comments in the file with instructions on where your edits should go, follow them. Please note:\n",
    "- Use simple SQL constructs as much as possible, and only those supported by PostgreSQL.\n",
    "- PostgreSQL does not allow subqueries in **CHECK**.\n",
    "- PostgreSQL does not support **CREATE ASSERTION**.\n",
    "- In PostgreSQL, date-time values (of type TIMESTAMP) can be represented by string literals of format, e.g., '2000-01-01 12:30:00'. These values can be compared using <, <=, =, etc., with expected semantics.\n",
    "- PostgreSQL’s implementation of triggers deviates from the SQL standard. In particular, you will need to define a \"UDF\" (user-defined function) to execute as the trigger body. In order to complete this problem, you will need to consult the documentation at https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/plpgsql-trigger.html and take a look at the [trigger examples](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/plpgsql-trigger.html#PLPGSQL-TRIGGER-EXAMPLE) in the doc.\n",
    "- Particularly useful are special variables such as **NEW, TG_OP, TG_TABLE_NAME**, as well as the **RAISE EXCEPTION** statement.\n",
    "- You may find these SQL functions useful: [CASE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/functions-conditional.html#FUNCTIONS-CASE) and [CAST](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/sql-expressions.html#SQL-SYNTAX-TYPE-CASTS).\n",
    "- You can enforce constraints either by rejecting database modifications that violate constraints, or by silently ignoring, changing, or augmenting the database modifications to keep constraints. For this problem, we want you to take the first approach of rejecting them (the first option in lecture). That means e.g., using RAISE EXCEPTION in triggers, and NOT using options such as DELETE ON CASCADE.\n"

    "- (c) There is no room for mistakes at PITS. Since PITS records only completed trades, enforce that the Trade table is append-only (i.e., no DELETE or UPDATE is allowed) using a trigger. Further enforce that within each account, trades must be recorded sequentially over time: i.e., compared with old trades in the same account, a new trade must have a seq that is strictly larger, and a timestamp that is no less than the old values.\n",
    "- (d) Using triggers, enforce that brokers cannot own accounts, either by themselves or jointly with others.\n",
    "- (e) Define a view Holds (aid, sym, amount) that returns the current account holdings, computed from the Trade table.
